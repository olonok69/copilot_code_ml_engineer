# kg — ticket knowledge graph query

## When to use

- Stage **1 Orient** of the methodology.
- User mentions a ticket id, symptom area, extractor, or “have we seen this before?”.
- Before broad reads under `data/changes/`.

## Procedure

1. If the repo has knowledge-graph scripts (often under `docs/knowledge-graph/` or `data/knowledge-graph/`), run the local query helper, e.g.:

```bash
# Adjust path to the real script in this repo
./docs/knowledge-graph/kg_query.sh "<ticket-or-topic>"       # neighbours (explain)
./docs/knowledge-graph/kg_query.sh "<A>" "<B>"              # shortest path between two tickets/topics
./docs/knowledge-graph/kg_query.sh find <substring>         # discover exact node names
```

If a topic resolves to the wrong node, run `find <substring>` to get the exact node id, then re-query.

On Windows PowerShell, prefer the same script via `bash`/`wsl` if that is how the project runs it.

2. Read **only** the files/nodes the query says to read (related tickets + sharp-edge / danger zone).
3. Also check live state: `git branch -a`, `gh pr list` (status-first).
4. Summarize for the human: prior art, locked invariants, suggested base branch — **do not start coding**.

## Fallback (no graph)

If query tools/artifacts are missing:

1. Search `data/changes/STATUS.md` for the topic / symptom terms.
2. Open the newest matching `data/changes/<id>/<id>.md`.
3. Skim `data/changes/SHARP_EDGES.md`.
4. Use `git log --oneline -- <paths>` for file-overlap history.

State clearly that you used the fallback.

## Output format

```text
KG / history-first
- Query: …
- Related tickets: …
- Danger zones / sharp edges: …
- Live status (branch/PRs): …
- What to read next: …
- Recommendation: (base / constraints / whether to proceed to triage)
```

## Invocation per surface (GitHub Copilot)

All surfaces that can run `bash` + Python (CLI, VS Code, cloud agent if the graph is committed — it usually is not, because it lives under gitignored `data/`).

- **Copilot CLI:** type `/kg` or let the agent pick it from the `description`. Manage with `/skills` or `copilot skill list|add|remove`.
- **VS Code (Copilot or Local harness):** `/kg` in chat; manage in **Chat: Open Customizations**.
- **Copilot cloud agent / code review:** automatic selection only (by `description`).
- ⚠️ The Copilot CLI does **not** read `~/.claude/skills/` (VS Code does). A personal copy goes in `~/.copilot/skills/kg/` (or `~/.agents/skills/`), or register the folder with `copilot skill add <dir>` / `COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS`. Project copy: `.github/skills/kg/SKILL.md`.
- Frontmatter is Copilot-valid: `name` equals the folder name (lowercase-hyphen — VS Code silently drops a mismatch), `description` ≤ 1024 characters, no `trigger:` key.

Deterministic, no LLM at query time: a direct port of the Claude Code / Cursor skill.
